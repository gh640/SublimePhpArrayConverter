Dependencies
------------

This package needs `php` command to work.


Usage
-----

Commands:

You can run the conversion from the command palette.

1. Open the command palette (ctrl/cmd + shift + p).
2. Select `PhpArrayConverter: Convert array`.

If you are selecting a part of text when running the command, only arrays in it are targeted. If there's no text selected, all arrays in the active file will be converted.

Settings:

The default settings are set as below.

```json
{
  "auto_convert_on_save": false,
  "path": ""
}
```

These values can be overwritten through `Preferences` - `Package settings` - `PhpArrayConverter` - `Settings - User`.

- `auto_convert_on_save` is a setting to turn on/off the auto conversion function. The default value is `false` and the auto conversion function is disabled. If you want to enable the auto conversion, set this to `true` in your setting file.
- `path` is a value which is converted to the environment variable `$PATH` when `php` command to tokenize the php code is run. Change this value to specify which `php` should be used in your environment.
